   <h2>A <em>Cool</em> Solution</h2>
    <p>We all love our liquids to stay cool in the hot summertime, as such I am making this recipe to teach you how to freeze dihydrogen monoxide and use it to keep liquids at a reasonable temperature in the hot weather</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>2 cups approx. Liquid Dihydrogen Monoxide</li>
      </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Take ice cube trays to your sink and fill them with cold dihydrogen monoxide liquid.</li>
        <li>Place the dihydrogen monoxide trays in your freezer.</li>
        <li>Shut the door to your freezer.</li>
        <li>Allow around 4-6 hours for the dihydrogen monoxide to freeze and enter a solid state.</li>
        <li>(Optional) Feel free to experiment with other liquids like fruit juices etc.</li>
      </ol>
